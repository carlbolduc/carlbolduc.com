        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>I offer development and server administration services. My sweet spot is anything that is related to web development. I can build a site in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and develop web services in Java/Ruby/Python</p>
        <h2>Interest</h2>
        <p>I'm passionate about science, more particularly life science. I did extensive studies in biology and contributed to in the adipose tissue field. During my post-graduated studies, I started to develop programs to analyse the overwhelming data that my experiments were generating. I then started a career in tech and I never stopped learning about programming since then. Today, I live my passion about life science through physical training and nutrition.</p>
